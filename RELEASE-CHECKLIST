Osmium release checklist
========================

SCM organization
----------------

* 3 main branches: 
  * production (stable channel);
  * master (going in the next minor release);
  * staging (going in the next major release).

* Other branches:
  * experimental-* for code that may never be merged at all;
  * staging-vX for specific staging branches;
  * vX-hotfixes for last-minute trivial fixes.

* production branch is always on a tagged commit (vA.B.C-foo).
