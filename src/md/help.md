## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) {#faq}

### How do I import a fitting from within the game?

* if you want to import from a kill report, copy the CREST URL and
  [import](../import) it;

* if you want to import a fitting someone posted in chat, you can
  copy/paste the message containing the link, and import that *(NB: it
  only works for messages actually posted in the chat, not in the
  redaction area)*;

* the longest way, but that should always work, is to save the fitting
  then export is as an XML file in the client; you can then import the
  file.
