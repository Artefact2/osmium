Title: Osmium expenses

For reference (and for transparency), here are the expenses of the
Osmium project. If you choose to [donate](index.xhtml#support), your money will
very likely go into one of these things!

* (2013-12 — current) **Tetroxide server** (the machine behind
  [o.smium.org](https://o.smium.org/)). We are currently using a VPS
  from [RamNode](https://www.ramnode.com/). **Cost: $10.44 monthly.**
  If you plan to buy a VPS from them and want to help out, you can use
